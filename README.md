# Snowflake-Datawarehouse-Mini-Project
## Description

This repository contains SQL queries and data modeling examples that showcase the data warehousing and analytical capabilities of the Snowflake Data Platform. The project uses the TPCH_SF1 schema from the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA database alongside the COMPUTE_WH warehouse to perform a series of queries that demonstrate insightful data manipulation and analysis.

## Contents

- SQL queries to find total sales per customer, top-selling products, average order values by region, order shipment efficiency, and suppliers with the highest supply costs.
- ER Model of the TPCH_SF1 schema.
- Screenshots of executed queries and their results.

## Insights

The queries are designed to provide valuable business insights such as:
- Identifying high-value customers and top-selling products.
- Analyzing transaction values by region.
- Assessing the efficiency of the shipping process.
- Evaluating supplier costs to optimize supply chain management.

## Getting Started

To run these queries on your own Snowflake instance, ensure that you have access to the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA database and COMPUTE_WH warehouse. Clone this repository, set up your Snowflake environment, and run the queries in your SQL editor.
